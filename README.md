# PlaygroundIOS 🚀

A comprehensive iOS development playground project built with SwiftUI, implementing MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns.

## 📱 About

PlaygroundIOS is an exploration project that serves as a learning resource and playground for iOS development using SwiftUI. This project demonstrates best practices in iOS development, clean architecture, and modern design patterns.

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture approach combining MVVM and DDD patterns:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Better testability
  - Reactive UI updates
  - Maintainable codebase

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
  - Rich domain models
  - Bounded contexts
  - Ubiquitous language
  - Domain services
